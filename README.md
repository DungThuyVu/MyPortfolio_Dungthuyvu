## Project 9 in collaboration to plartform Chall

### Activity-Specific Banner Insertion for Sports Video Platforms
Collaboration: [Chall.no](https://www.chall.no/) ‚Äî a Norwegian digital platform for community-driven sports video challenges and sponsorship engagement.  
Status:üîí Private due to GDPR compliance and data confidentiality from user-generated content on the Chall platform.

---

###  Objective
This project addresses the challenge of "automatically and contextually integrating sponsorship banners# into user-generated sports videos, leveraging efficiency for digital marketing.
Traditional static advertisement placement often obstructs visual content or fails to match the video‚Äôs context, degrading both viewer experience and marketing impact.

---

### Proposed Framework
A novel "AI-driven pipeline" was developed to achieve adaptive, context-aware banner integration:
1. Activity Recognition:  
   - Sport classification using "SlowFast R50" architecture on Kinetics-400 and Chall datasets.  
2. Context-Aware Banner Generation: 
   - Utilized text-to-image diffusion models ‚Äî FLUX.1-schnell, HiDream, and DeepFloyd ‚Äî to synthesize visually coherent sponsor banners.  
3. Dynamic Placement and Tracking:  
   - Employed YOLOv8 for object detection, DeepSORT for tracking, and RAFT-Small for optical flow estimation.  
   - Integrated Segment Anything Model (SAM) for saliency-based, non-intrusive placement aligned with motion and depth.

---

###  Evaluation
- Datasets: Kinetics-400 benchmark + sports videos from the Chall platform (skiing, skating, running).  
- Performance Highlights:  
  - High classification accuracy for visually distinct sports.  
  - FLUX.1-schnell produced the most semantically coherent banners.  
  - SAM-based placement yielded the most visually and contextually aligned advertisement integration.  

---

###  Research Impact
This work bridges the gap between computer vision and digital advertising, enabling adaptive, viewer-aware ad placement that respects video integrity and user experience.  
The methodology supports future deployment on Chall‚Äôs commercial video infrastructure and other UGC (user-generated content) platforms.
